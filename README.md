This project is a full-stack MongoDB analytics platform built around real-world AirBnB data. I ingested and transformed over 500MB of raw CSV data, designing a flexible schema using MongoDB collections for listings, calendar, reviews, and neighborhoods. Using PyMongo and Python, I cleaned and normalized the data (e.g., parsing dates, standardizing price formats, and extracting embedded arrays) to ensure consistency and query efficiency. I implemented compound indexing strategies to optimize performance for common access patterns like availability filtering, neighborhood queries, and time-based review aggregation.

The core of the system is a suite of advanced analytical queries written in Python using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. These include logic for detecting booking gaps, finding underrepresented neighborhoods, analyzing monthly availability trends, and identifying returning guests. All queries were designed, tested, and documented by me as part of a standalone prototype system. The project demonstrates my ability to handle both the backend data architecture and the application-level logic necessary to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.
